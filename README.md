## User Story
AS A coding bootcamp student. I WANT an online portfolio. SO THAT I can showcase my completed projects.

##Acceptance Criteria
When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

## Method

1. Added 'a href' to navigation for About, Work, Contact Me and Resume

2. Added structure to 'About', 'Work', 'Contact'
